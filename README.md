counting pips on dominoes in a picture

I was tired of both losing at dominoes when playing mexican train and having to count a ridiculous amount of pips (the dots on a domino).  I figured this was a great use of computer vision since the pips are dark and the face of the domino is white.  I made a script to do this task so I didn't have to count them.
